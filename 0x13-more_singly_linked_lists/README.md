0x13. C - More singly linked lists

In this project you learn more about singly linked lits and how works together.
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone,
How to use linked lists

0. Print list
a function that prints all the elements of a list. (prepared to use recursion)

1. List length
a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list. (maybe more recursion :D)

2. Add node
a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list.

3. Add node at the end
a function that adds a new node at the end of a list.

4. Free list
a function that frees a list. (together we learn to use free, maybe you want to take pencil and paper in your hand)

5. Free
a function that frees a list. (more free but for what?)

6. Pop
a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).

7. Get node at index
a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

8. Sum list
a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

9. Insert
a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

10. Delete at index
a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
